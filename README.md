# equiptbcmobileapi
a collaboration with a group to play around with creating an api

Back End Review Project 

You are in charge of creating a back end for a newly founded mobile 
telecom company. They are looking to expand quickly and want to acquire 
as many customers as possible. Your job is to create an API that performs 
the following actions: 

•Adds customers to the company database

Each customer should have a first name, last name, phone 
number, city, state, and gender

•Allows a customer to edit their profile information

•Removes customers who have discontinued service

For this job, you will also need to keep track of each customer’s phone bill. 
A phone bill should consist of the following:

•An id number, the billing amount, number of minutes used, number of 
texts sent, amount of data consumed, number of outgoing calls made

The API you create for your company should be able to also create new 
bills, adjust bills in case of error, as well as delete bills altogether. Since 
this company is just getting started, a front end is not required, but all 
endpoints should be testable via Insomnia, Postman, or cUrl commands.
